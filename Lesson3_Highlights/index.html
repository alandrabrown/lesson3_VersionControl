            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records whenever a change is made to a file or set of files. The purpose of this is so that a user can recall a specific version of that fine. The system allows a user to see changes made to a file over time, who modified it, and it also allows a user to revert files back to their previous state. This is useful because in the event that a file is lost, it can be recovered easily. There are a few different version control methods including the local, centralized, and distributed version control systems. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Most users version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory because it is the most simple. However, it is also the most prone to error because users may forget which directory theyâ€™re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over the wrong files. Centralized Version Control Systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.  Distributed Version Control Systems fully mirror the repository. If a server dies these systems can copy repositories back up to the server to restore it. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git treats the data much more like a collection of snapshots. Each time a user saves their project in Git, it basically takes snapshots of the files and stores it. This is what sets Git apart from nearly every other version control system. Git is described as more of a mini filesystem with additional powerful tools. Most operations is Git only require local files and/or resources to operate. Usually, there is no additional information needed from any other computer on the network. With Git users will have access to the entire history of a particular project on the local disk.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Creating a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a couple of approaches to using a Git project. A user can take an existing project and import in into Git, or they can clone an existing Git repository from another server. To import an existing project into Git certain commands must be entered to create a new subdirectory containing all of the necessary repository files. Then, a user can begin tracking the files and save by using git commands to determine which files to track. To copy an existing Git repository, a user would need to use a specific command to clone that repository. Git will receive a full copy of all of the data the server has.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each file in the directory are either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are the files that are snapshotted and can be modifies or staged. Anything else in the directory is untracked. When a repository is first cloned, all of the files are tracked and nothing has been edited or modified. Once a user begins editing, Git seems them being modified. These files are staged as modified files and then all of the users staged changes are saved. Changes need to be made and snapshots should be saved each time a user reaches a point where they want to record stages.</p>
